                    <p>
                        I am a student at Thinkful, under their
                        Software Engineering course, and am located in Austin,
                        Texas.

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I have experience in a few coding languages so far such
                        as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and C++. Currently, I am learning
                        to code with the Thinkful program but have a bit of
                        experience with coding by teaching myself and am always
                        looking to expand my knowledge on coding languages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My interests outside of coding are working on my small
                        hobbies such as playing guitar and playing video games.
                        I Have been learning to play guitar for 2 years now and
                        I have been playing video games since I can remember.
